Practicing unit testing in Java applications with Spring Boot, using JUnit as the testing framework and Mockito for creating mocks and simulating behavior.

During this process, I worked with a MySQL database, integrating Spring Data JPA and Hibernate and Postman to test Rest API's.

This study has allowed me to:

-Write clean tests;

-Simulate real scenarios in an isolated and reliable way;

-Improve code quality best practices.
